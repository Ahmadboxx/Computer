How computers work:

Input (Data):Input is the raw information entered into a computer from the input devices. It is the collection of letters, numbers, images etc.

Process: Process is the operation of data as per given instruction. It is totally internal process of the computer system.Output: Output is the processed data given by computer after data processing. 

Output is also called as Result. We can save these results in the storage devices for the future use.computers contain the following :

1-Ram used to read any order, it is found with variable speeds and sizes.

2-Cpu: A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.

3-Gpu A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a computer chip that performs rapid mathematical calculations, primarily for the purpose of rendering images.

4-mother board is a circuit board that is used to pass an electric current to other parts.


5-Hard disk is aa disk that is fitted on the motherboard which can make a space to save your work.

Some Interesting Facts About Computers & Its Operating Systems:

The first digital computers were developed between 1940 to 1945.Konrad Zuse, In 1941 developed “Z3”,

the first modern computing machine.Konrad Zuse is regarded as “the inventor of computers”.

ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator & Computer) was the first US-built electronic computer.

ENIAC was developed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert.

The world’s first stored-program computer was “Manchester Baby” developed in 1948.
